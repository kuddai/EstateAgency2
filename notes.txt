If you are using display none on table rows then when they reappear other parts of the table account new rows very strangely in terms of margin.
If pre-wrap is (or one of them) on and the text-align: justify is on then it doesn't work properly.
If you just put something in thead, then it will be rendered outside table.
CSS animations work only when you change properties explicitly (width, height are good examples because they very often are set indirectly based on their content)
